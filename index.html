  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Paris Spices
Spices have a long and ancient history, especially in India, where they are a part of life and heritage. In every home & in every province across the country, different spices and blends are used to create different and distinctive tastes in dishes. Several decades ago, housewives used to grind their spices manually at home and make their own blends for use in their cooking.Me and My team visualised the concept of ready-to-use ground spices.

Starting with manually ground spices, Paris Spices soon switched over to automatic machines to meet the fast growing demand for Paris Spices. So much so today spices worth crores of rupees are manufactured and packed by modern machines and sold throughout India  through a network of over 1000 Stockists and over 4 Lacs retail dealers. These machines now have a capacity of producing 30 tones of spices in powders packed in beautiful consumer pack of different sizes (10g to 500g) in a day.</p>
